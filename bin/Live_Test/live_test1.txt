Consider a Dart program managing a list of fruits. Each fruit has attributes like name, color, and price.

Create a Dart list named fruits with at least three fruits, represented as maps.
Write a function displayFruitDetails that takes the fruits list as a parameter and prints out the details of each fruit.
Implement a function applyPriceDiscount() that takes the fruits list and a discount percentage as parameters. This function should update the price of each fruit by applying the discount.

Sample I/O:

Original Fruit Details before Discount:
Name: Apple, Color: Red, Price: $2.5
Name: Banana, Color: Yellow, Price: $1.0
Name: Grapes, Color: Purple, Price: $3.0

Fruit Details After Applying 10% Discount:
Name: Apple, Color: Red, Price: $2.25
Name: Banana, Color: Yellow, Price: $0.9
Name: Grapes, Color: Purple, Price: $2.7
